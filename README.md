- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GillianLaw
- 
Iâ€™m learning to code after a career as a technology journalist, and Iâ€™ve discovered I love it â€“ so much so that Iâ€™m now looking to move into a coding job. 

I can bring a lot to the programming world: Iâ€™m a great listener and communicator, I can really get to understand what works for people and how to help them. I also love taking complex things and making them easy to understand, and thatâ€™s a real strength of coding, I feel. 

Iâ€™m a 50-something woman who loves technology. There are more people like me than you might think, and I think I can bring a fresh perspective to the tech world. 

So far I feel more drawn to data analysis than to front end work, but Iâ€™m trying to study widely and understand where my strengths are. Iâ€™m also building up my projects as I think thatâ€™s where Iâ€™ll really find â€“ and be able to show â€“ what Iâ€™m good at.
